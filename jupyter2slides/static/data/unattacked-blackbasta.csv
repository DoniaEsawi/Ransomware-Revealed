Angell developed sheet cake that rolled without cracking and married it with ice cream to create the ice cream cake roll. Described as the perfect marriage of ice cream and cake, it even became the inspiration for the company’s name. Newly Weds Foods would take its first strategic turn in the early 1950’s, making food coatings for the emerging frozen food industry. By the mid-fifties, Newly Weds Foods had become the largest producer of customized food coatings in the U.S., a position we continue to hold to this day. This move had taken the company into ingredient manufacturing and established a platform for future success.

Over the past 7 decades, Newly Weds has expanded manufacturing beyond North America to include Europe, Asia and beyond. Capabilities have grown from bread crumbs and other food coating systems to seasonings and sauces, as well as food safety and functional ingredients. Today, Newly Weds Foods is a world leader in food ingredient innovation. Our network of R&D, Culinary and manufacturing facilities around the globe allows us to serve customer     needs in more than 94 countries. 

Despite our size and scope, we’ve continued to be an independent, privately-held business answerable only to the demands of our customers. That is why we’ve consistently invested in infrastructure, human resources and capacity over the years to keep pace with their growing needs. And, why we are ready to address the sourcing and formula challenges the food industry will be facing tomorrow.

TGI Fridays....1965, Manhattan Upper East Side.  Where it all began.  Where could young adults go out to meet friends and make new ones in an environment that was at once both relaxed and yet exciting?

The answer was nowhere...until Alan Stillman opened TGI Fridays!

Suddenly, there was a place that filled you with a Friday feeling no matter when you walked in.  A place with great food, new and exciting drinks, and electric energy.  A place where bartenders mixed the environment just as well as they mixed drinks, and ""ring the bell"" service heightened the experience for everyone.  In short, a place like nowhere else.

The concept was wildly successful.  Young people stood six deep around the bar.  They spilled outside the restaurant, becoming known as the first ""cocktail party on the streets"".

AMERICA'S MOST ICONIC BAR AND GRILL WAS BORN.

Today, the promise of the freeing feeling of Friday lives on....because ""In here, it's ALWAYS Friday!""  Come join the party, the infectious energy, indulgent food, authentic service and amazing drinks.  

If you are passionate about taking care of people through your hospitality, you have lots of energy and want to grow your career!
