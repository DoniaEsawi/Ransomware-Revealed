After fuel was deregulated by the government in 1981, the first of 20 convenience stores and car washes were opened and a wholesale supply division was formed. In 1985, a CITGO distributorship was purchased, which allowed Garrow Oil & Propane to franchise other convenience stores and start a motor oil and lubricant division.
In 2003, Garrow Oil & Propane extended its distribution network by adding the BP brand. Garrow Oil & Propane now has a distribution network of 100+ convenience stores and truck stops throughout Wisconsin, Michigan and Illinois.
We are licensed wholesalers in nine states and supply fuel to many trucking companies, farms, municipalities and construction companies.
