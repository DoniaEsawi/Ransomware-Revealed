Proxibid offers four transaction methods—buy now, make offer, timed auction, and live auction—ensuring buyers and sellers can transact how they want, when they want. For sellers, Proxibid offers a 24x7 sales channel that means you’re always open for business. Buyers know they can count on Proxibid for unique and hard-to-find items they won’t find anywhere else online.

Proxibid offers the industry’s most sophisticated risk management system, specifically designed to facilitate transactions for high value items like heavy construction equipment, industrial machinery, collector cars, antiques, real estate, and more. The company’s industry-low non-pay rate of 0.15 percent means sellers get paid at the end of their sales―something no other online provider can ensure. That, combined with a robust online platform that boasts 99.9+ percent uptime, makes Proxibid the most trusted place to buy and sell highly valued items online.

In February 2015, the companies announced an agreement to integrate item listings in the heavy construction equipment and industrial machinery categories directly into the eBay marketplace. This technology went live in November, and the partnership is already generating revenue for both companies.

In August 2015, Proxibid received a significant growth investment from Primus Capital, and Ohio-based private equity firm. This capital infusion has allowed the company to expedite product technical development and increase capacity in both sales and marketing.

The AAE serves as the primary source of continuing education in endodontics for its members, the dental profession, the public and others. As an educational and social medium, the AAE Annual Session attracts endodontists and other dental professionals from around the world to exchange ideas and learn the latest endodontic techniques and research. Smaller educational conferences are offered around the United States.
