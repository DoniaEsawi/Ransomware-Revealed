YMCA Buffalo Niagara is a charitable not-for-profit health and human services organization founded to help people, not make a profit. We earn our tax exempt status every day by making available and accessible much needed services in the community.

Our goal is to close the gaps in opportunity and achievement that consign far too many young people—especially those from low-income families or who are black, Latino, or American Indian—to lives on the margins of the American mainstream.

Although many organizations speak up for the adults employed by schools and colleges, we speak up for students, especially those whose needs and potential are often overlooked. We evaluate every policy, every practice, and every dollar spent through a single lens: what is right for students.

We work alongside educators, parents, students, policymakers, and civic and business leaders in communities across the country, providing practical assistance in their efforts to transform schools and colleges into institutions that serve all students well.  

We analyze local, state, and national data and use what we learn to help build broader understanding of achievement and opportunity gaps and the actions necessary to close them.  

We participate actively in national and state policy debates, bringing lessons learned from on-the-ground work and from unflinching data analyses to build the case for policies that will help all students and schools reach high levels of achievement.

Our Core Beliefs:
We believe in the power of education to close the gaps that separate low-income students and students of color from other young Americans. 

We believe that schools and colleges, appropriately organized, can help virtually all students master the knowledge they need to succeed.  

We believe long-standing gaps in opportunity, achievement, and attainment have roots inside and outside of schools. And though we know these gaps are stubborn, we also know they are not inevitable.  

We believe a strong education improves the lives of young people, is vital to sustaining our democracy, and strengthens America.",-77.02887,38.899807,active,22841744,117,"['Amazon Cloudfront', 'Google Analytics', 'Google Tag Manager', 'Gravatar', 'WordPress']"
