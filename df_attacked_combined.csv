Offering up a wine to the market is a way of communicating one's own way of being and philosophy, and of transmitting an ancient culture through aromas, emotions and memories. It is a gift to enhance the quality of life, through a promise Cantina Tollo has always kept: that its wines tell a story. 

If Cantina Tollo's mission is based on the will to keep the relationship between man and the land very much alive, its products naturally transmit the spirit of this mission even whilst utilising the latest technology.

Modern methods and research cannot bring a cold, distant feel to a what is in reality a richly poetic and joyful world and way of working.

Il mercato degli ascensori cresce poi rapidamente in Italia e, complici il figlio Paolo e la nuora Elvira, l’azienda si trasforma da concessionario ad installatore indipendente e infine a costruttore.

oltre tre generazioni hanno portato Belletti a crescere e svilupparsi sempre più.

As a construction company, we believe it’s our responsibility to work with determination and vision, delivering craftsmanship that will stand the test of time. That’s because the structures we build give shape to the future of our communities. They are the spaces where people will spend some of the most important moments of their lives; facilities that help governments serve their communities, and buildings that ready businesses for their next phases of growth.

Over 25 years since our founding, those central principles guide all that we do. Every one of us at Conger—from owner to apprentice—is dedicated to building smarter, stronger, and safer, building facilities where our partners, our clients, and our communities will work, play and live.

Over the last 50 years, we have studied thousands of hours of Lightning Strike Data over the millions of hours of our systems operations - all for the purpose of continually improving our unique Prediction and Detection Technology incorporating state-of-the-art hardware. THOR GUARD's ongoing goal is to continue creating and distributing the safest Lightning Warning Systems in the World and doing so with our own exceptional Designers, Engineers and Meteorologists!

THOR GUARD has always detected lightning, but it is our prediction algorithms that have enabled our Lightning Prediction Systems to stand apart from any other company claiming to be our competitor. Don’t be misled by lightning detection companies that utilize delayed and inaccurate detection networks. Detection companies require an actual lightning strike to occur before a warning is issued that it is no longer safe to be outdoors! How is that considered 'lightning safety'? Thor Guard, on the other hand, was engineered to warn PRIOR to a first strike in a defined area near a sensor so people can safely seek shelter BEFORE that first strike occurs.

Customers must decide what the value of a life is. Why have peoples lives depend on a cheap phone app when you could trust the industry leader in weather and lightning-related predictions with a long history of technological advancement and reliability? Read through our website - a good education is a great foundation for making wise decisions!",United States,"06 Oct, 2022 05:24:31 UTC","THOR GUARD, the leader in lightning prediction, is committed to utilize emerging technologies in the development of systems that provide automatic notification of hazardous weather conditions.

The THOR GUARD Lightning Prediction System has been manufactured in South Florida since 1976. Over the ensuing years, representing literally millions of hours of accurate and safe operations, THOR GUARD has consistently proven its reliability. THOR GUARD uses a highly sophisticated sensor and computer to measure and analyze the electrostatic field in the atmosphere. Lightning originates within this field, thus allowing THOR GUARD to make calculations predicting its occurrence, even though there may be no visible evidence of lightning. Lightning ""detection"" systems require the occurrence of an actual lightning strike before a warning is given. Many times this is just too late.

THOR GUARD is the only stand alone lightning warning device used at all National Championships conducted by the United States Golf Association, the Canadian and European Golf Tours and many local sections of the PGA of America. We are the choice of Marriott Golf, the PGA Tournament Players Clubs, ABC Television Sports, and the Atlanta Summer Olympics. The flexibility of our system not only accommodates private golf facilities needing plenty of advance warning (20 or more minutes), but also public facilities looking for only 8 to 18 minutes of warning to ensure revenue flow. 

THOR GUARD is also highly regarded and utilized by many non-golf industries as well. Some of our significant customers include American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air Canada, United, Fed Ex, UPS, Freeport McMoRan (FMI) Mining, BHP Billiton Mining, Shell Oil, ATF, US Marine Corps, US NAVY, US ARMY, Motorola, AT&T, and over 700 universities, schools and municipalities.

Founded in 1898, Overseas AST was a major construction company based in Europe. In 1959 Overseas AST established operations in Dubai and in 1964 the business was officially incorporated by a Ruler’s Decree.

In 1983, two prominent UAE businessmen, Khalifa Juma Al Nabooda of Dubai and Abdulla Mohammed Al Mazrouei of Abu Dhabi, acquired a 51% share in the business. They acquired the remaining shareholding from the parent company in 2003.

Since the successful completion of the landmark Al Maktoum bridge in Dubai 1962, Overseas AST now operates as a proudly UAE owned company with its Head Office in Dubai and branch offices in Abu Dhabi and Sharjah.
The bodies of the Agency are made up of the Director, the Management Committee, the Board of Auditors.
From 1 December 2012 the Revenue Agency incorporated the Territory Agency (article 23-quater of Legislative Decree 95/2012).",United Arab Emirates,"01 Aug, 2022 10:48:33 UTC","Overseas AST LLC is one of the longest established construction companies in the UAE.
With a head office in Dubai, we have offices in Abu Dhabi and Sharjah and operate in the UAE and other Gulf countries.
AST was founded in Austria in 1898 by an engineer, Eduard Wilhelm Ast, and grew to be one of Europe’s biggest contractors. The company ventured overseas to Kuwait in 1954 and began operations in Dubai in 1959. 
At that time, oil production had still to begin and the formation of the United Arab Emirates was more than a decade away.
The first electricity had been produced by private generators only a few years earlier and kerosene lamps were the main form of lighting. Water was still distributed around town in metal containers.
The bustling souq in Deira had 350 shops in covered walkways and was the largest market in the region. 
The population of around 50,000 mainly lived in huts constructed from palm fronds.
Across the Creek in Shindaga was the home of the Ruler and the wealthier families who lived in homes constructed of coral and gypsum from the salt marshes.
As today, the Creek divided Dubai and the only way between the two banks was a long journey around the end or on a rowing boat – the abra, which even today is a mainstay of the city’s transportation.

Proud to be a UAE company

The company’s first project in Dubai in 1959 was to develop the Creek and build the Maktoum Bridge, just the first of numerous landmark projects which have since helped change the face of the UAE.
In 1983, two prominent UAE businessmen, Khalifa Juma Al Nabooda of Dubai and Abdulla Mohammed Al Mazrui of Abu Dhabi, acquired a 51% stake in the company. 
  
They bought the remainder in 2003. Currently Overseas AST is owned by two prominent groups, Khalifa Juma Al Nabooda Group and Al Mazrui Holding Company.

COMPANY HISTORY IN SHEET VINYL FLOORING
Lonseal, Inc. is a subsidiary of Lonseal Corporation in Tokyo and was established in Southern California in 1972. The company quickly established itself as a provider of unique sheet vinyl flooring designs with distinctive color choices. In the early 80s, Lonplate — the original steel-plate design adapted to resilient flooring — put Lonseal on the map as a creator of innovative, embossed products. Additionally, Lonseal’s technological advances bolstered the company’s reputation as it infused products with pliable properties not associated with vinyl.

Lonseal® is known as “the little giant” in the sheet vinyl flooring industry. Our corporate sales office in Carson, California, has a team with an average of 30 years of sheet vinyl flooring experience! Our product line is most often specified by designers and architects because we focus on making one thing … products that will over-deliver the quality a project requires. Not only does our flooring exceed expectations, Lonseal is more flexible and can easily customize products to meet our clients’ needs.",United States,"11 Jul, 2022 18:53:42 UTC","Lonseal, Inc. | 232 followers on LinkedIn.

United Health Centers of the San Joaquin Valley is a private non-profit organization, incorporated in January 1971, whose purpose is to provide comprehensive medical, dental and community health services to the medically underserved in the central San Joaquin Valley. We are licensed by the State of California as a community health center, and the Federal and State governments designated us as a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). 

The United Health Centers service area is located in the heart of California in the Central San Joaquin Valley. The San Joaquin Valley is considered the richest agricultural area in the United States. The agricultural economy of the San Joaquin Valley depends heavily on a farm labor force which is made up primarily of local agricultural and farm workers.

United Health Centers of the San Joaquin Valley is a private non-profit organization, incorporated in January 1971, whose purpose is to provide comprehensive medical, dental and community health services to the medically underserved in the central San Joaquin Valley. We are licensed by the State of California as a community health center, and the Federal and State governments designated us as a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). 

The United Health Centers service area is located in the heart of California in the Central San Joaquin Valley. The San Joaquin Valley is considered the richest agricultural area in the United States. The agricultural economy of the San Joaquin Valley depends heavily on a farm labor force which is made up primarily of local agricultural and farm workers. During the peak harvest season migrant workers from throughout the Southwestern United States come to assist in the harvesting of a variety of fruits and vegetables. The area is considered the highest migrant impact area in the County.
