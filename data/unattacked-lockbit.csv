Durable, designable, and  high-quality,  made from 100% solid vinyl solutions. The line has continued to expand, now including AquaTread Marine Flooring, Transit, GrowFloor, and most recently, BILD Print Media.

Better Life Technology, LLC was founded in 1998 by Don & Brett Sneed in Lenexa, KS, when Brett identified a need for an easy to install and maintain, durable garage floor protector. He worked with Don to develop G-Floor, which is made of thick, solid vinyl and rolls out for easy installation. They positioned G-Floor against traditional epoxy floors, which can take up to 16 days to fully install and are prone to cracking, staining and peeling if not installed properly. Because it is compatible with alkais and acids in concrete, G-Floor protects garage floors without breaking down the subfloor.

Since 2004, Better Life Technology, LLC has added new color options, textures and dimensions, and has been featured in many home improvement magazines and television shows. G-Floor can also be found in more than 1,200 retail stores nationwide, as well as via a variety of online distributors.",-94.77236,38.95223,active,,,"['Varnish', 'WooCommerce', 'WordPress']"

Contrary to common belief we feel innovation is not limited to a moment of solitary genius. It's not a revolutionary idea that pops up when you're alone instead it is a consistent process of formulating new proposals while being in direct contact with what is intended to innovate. And the most critical part is to get your innovation accepted amidst the chaos of disruption it brings to the same market. It is only then a business can continue to exist and bring long term results.

We believe in fostering open management styles by motivating our team to utilize their on field problems and failures for identifying opportunities for improvements.
